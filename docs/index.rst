This library is meant as a simple toolkit for working with data from 
https://api.wattsight.com/ (or equivalent services). Note that access is 
based on some sort of login credentials, this library is not all that useful 
unless you have a valid Wattsight account.

The library is tested against both Python 2.7 and Python 3.6, we 
recommend using Python 3.

This documentation contains the following pages:
