Fix the event listener implementation to be more robust.

NB! This changes the sseclient library used by wapi-python.
    There is a conflict in naming, so if you are upgrading
    from a previous version you _must_ manually uninstall
    the 'sseclient' package.  From this version onwards we
    use 'sseclient-py'.

Add examples for absolute/relative forecasts.

Make Pandas->Wapi TS conversion more robust.
