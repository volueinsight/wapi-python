Update tagged curve handling, if no tags are requested we now return
only the default tag (usually Avg).  This aligns with current API
behaviour.

Add string representations for classes to make it easier to work with,
include issue_date and tag in default pandas series names.

Remove name/curve cache, the gain is quite small and it broke
getting the latest modification time for the curve.

Update documentation strings, add example for the event system.

Require a sseclient version that works with both python 2.7 and 3.x.
