# wapi-python
Wattsight API python library

This library is meant as a simple toolkit for working with data from
https://api.wattsight.com/ (or equivalent services).  Note that access
is based on some sort of login credentials, this library is not all
that useful unless you have a valid Wattsight account.

The library is tested against both Python 2.7 and Python 3.6,
we recommend using Python 3.
